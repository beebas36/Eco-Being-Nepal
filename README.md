# Eco-Being-Nepal
Eco Being Nepal is a data analysis project focused on understanding sales performance, customer behaviour, and product trends for an eco-friendly e-commerce platform. The goal of this project is to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights that support better decision-making in inventory planning and sales strategy. In this project, I analyzed customer purchase data and product-level sales information to evaluate overall business performance. Using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques, I identified top-selling products and seasonal demand patterns that can help optimize stock management and improve operational efficiency.
